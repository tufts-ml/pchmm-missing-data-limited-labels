  """Annotates expected properties of a `Tensor`-valued distribution parameter.
  Distributions and Bijectors implementing `._parameter_properties` specify a
  `ParameterProperties` annotation for each of their `Tensor`-valued
  parameters.
  Elements:
    event_ndims: Python `int` rank of the parameter describing a single event
      (distributions) or a minimal transformation (bijectors,
      as determined by `Bijector.forward_min_event_ndims`). For
      example, `tfd.Normal` has scalar parameters, so would set `event_ndims=0`
      for both its `loc` and `scale` parameters. On the other hand,
      `tfd.MultivariateNormalTriL` has vector loc and matrix scale, so it would
      set `event_ndims=1` for `loc` and `event_ndims=2` for `scale_tril`.
      Default value: `0`.
    shape_fn: Python `callable` with signature
      `parameter_shape = shape_fn(shape)`. Given the desired shape of
      the return value of `self.sample()` (formally, the concatenation of
      self.batch_shape with self.event_shape), returns the expected shape of
      the parameter. May raise an exception if the shape cannot be inferred.
      Default value: `lambda shape: shape`.
    default_constraining_bijector_fn: Optional Python `callable` with signature
      `bijector = default_constraining_bijector_fn()`. The return value is a
      `tfb.Bijector` instance that maps from an unconstrained real-valued vector
      to the support of the parameter.
      Default value: `tfb.Identity`.
    is_preferred: Python bool value specifying whether this
      parameter should be passed when this distribution or bijector is
      automatically instantiated. Only one of a set of mutually-exclusive
      parameters, such as `logits` and `probs`, may set `is_preferred=True`.
      Default value: `True`.
  #### Choice of constraining bijectors
  The practical support of a parameter---defined as the regime in
  which the distribution may be expected to produce numerically
  valid samples and (log-)densities---may differ slightly from the
  mathematical support. For example, Normal `scale` is mathematically supported
  on positive real numbers, but in practice, dividing by very small scales may
  cause overflow. We might therefore prefer a bijector such as
  `tfb.Softplus(low=eps)` that excludes very small values.
  **In general, default constraining bijectors should attempt to
  implement a *practical* rather than mathematical support, and users of
  default bijectors should be aware that extreme elements of the mathematical
  support may not be attainable.** The notion of 'practical support' is
  inherently fuzzy, and defining it may require arbitrary choices. However,
  this is preferred to the alternative of allowing the default behavior to be
  numerically unstable in common settings. As a general guide, any
  restrictions on the mathematical support should be 'conceptually
  infinitesimal': it may be appropriate to constrain a Beta concentration
  parameter to be greater than `eps`, but not to be greater than `1 + eps`,
  since the latter is a non-infinitesimal restriction of the mathematical
  support.
