# Prediction-Constrained Markov Models for Medical Time Series with Missing Data and Few Labels

This repository contains code for reproducing the experiments for the "Prediction-Constrained Markov Models for Medical Time Series with Missing Data and Few Labels" paper. Experiments are segregated by dataset and contains code for data generation and running baselines: 

 - Toy 2-D (Figure 1 in the paper) 
 - eICU (Figure 2 in paper)
 - MIMIC-IV (Figure 2 in paper)

# Workflow
- Change directory to the experiment to reproduce
	- `cd {experiment_name}`
- Follow the readme in the individual experiments
