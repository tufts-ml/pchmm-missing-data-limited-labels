# Predicting Patient Outcomes from Time Series with Missing Data via a Semi-supervised Hidden Markov Model

This repository contains code for reproducing the experiments for the "Predicting Patient Outcomes from Time Series with Missing Data via a Semi-supervised Hidden Markov Model" paper. Experiments are segregated by dataset and contains code for data generation and running baselines: 
 
 - MIMIC-IV
 - eICU
 - Toy experiments

# Workflow
- Change directory to the experiment to reproduce
	- `cd {experiment_name}`
- Follow the readme in the individual experiments
